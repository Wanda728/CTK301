        <h2>History of Spring Break</h2>
        <p>The concept of spring break began in 1938 with a swim forum event in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. By around 1960, however, students had begun to come to the town in great numbers, and local businesses took advantage of this influx by offering specials such as all-you-can-drink beer for $1.50. Eventually, the town gained the nickname “Ft. Liquordale” and became the primary destination for students interested in partying during spring break for years to come.</p>

            <h2>Purpose of Spring Break</h2>
            <p> Spring Break is typically scheduled around the middle or end of the month of March so that students can get a bit of reprieve from hectic school responsibilities before finals and the last half of the school year. Spring break is often idealized as being a week of nonstop fun and traveling, and while it can be those things, spring break actually does have a ton of other mental and physical health benefits, too.</p>
